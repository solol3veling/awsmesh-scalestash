- add grouping (wip) (grouping by select and add color selection aswell for the highlight grouping, or creating a group and putting stuff in it automatically adds to the group, the group can also be treated as a node, only difference is it can be enlarged by selecting/dragging)
- currently, lets work on the container edges to show, the option bubble to show on hover and focus, i want the option to select multiple different color types for the container (hard and transparent colors), the container label should look better and smaller
- add aws groups
- add export as png, json, pdf (with or without bg)
- add share as link
- add node direct

- add save as (use localstorage) (done)
